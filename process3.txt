Money Dashboard was founded in 2010 by a small team in Edinburgh, passionate about making the often-confusing world of 
personal finance more open, transparent and accessible for everyone.

With a funding injection from Calculus Capital and a hugely successful crowdfund, giving our users the opportunity
to have a stake in the business, Money Dashboard evolved into an app named the UK's Best Personal Finance App 2017 & 2018 at The British Bank Awards.

The team today is still motivated by the mission to help all UK consumers get more happy & successful by empowering them to take control of their finances.
